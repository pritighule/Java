We create repository by using git hub dash board on browser 
Clone Repository(One time process when new repository created on remote):

1) goto the remote repository 
2) click on code button
3) go to SSH -> Copy the SSH URL (EX.git@github.com:pritighule/Java.git) 
4) Open Git bash in Local Folder (in PC) ->  git clone (paste Copied URL) //after this command in PC it will create folder with  repository name (Ex.Java                        folder )
5) go to the local folder (EX.Java Folder using command -> cd Java ) // by default git bash show main branch (EX.91744@SAGAR MINGW64 /c/Priti/Java (main))
6) create branch in above repository -> git chekout -b main
7) push above branch on remote location by using -> git push origin main
8) Check whether main branch is created on git remote location 
9) Create develop branch from main branch ->git checkout -b develop  //press enter
					  ->git push origin develop  //it will create develop branch on remote locaation

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:

1)open git bash from  local repository
2) checkout develop branch -> git checkout develop
3) create feature branch from develop branch locally -> git checkout -b feature/Division 
4) push branch on remote .-> git push origin feature/Division
5) write the code file in that folder 
6) push the code file on to the remote location by using following commands:
	i) git add .
	ii)git commit -a -m "Uploading Division Operation on remote location"
	iii)git push origin feature/Division
7)check on the remote location whether the change is refected on remote location or not .

For Updating Existing Files:

1) switch to branch where the code is present  -> git checkout branch name  (Ex.git checkout feature/Division)
2) to get latest data of branch into local folder -> git pull origin feature/Division
3) Check local folder file is present .
